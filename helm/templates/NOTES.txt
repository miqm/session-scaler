To setup KEDA session scaling on a deployment, create a ScaledObject with external trigger:

  apiVersion: keda.sh/v1alpha1
  kind: ScaledObject
  metadata:
    name: {scaled-object-name}
  spec:
    scaleTargetRef:
      apiVersion: {api-version-of-target-resource}  # Optional. Default: apps/v1
      kind: {kind-of-target-resource}               # Optional. Default: Deployment
      name: {name-of-target-resource}               # Mandatory. Must be in the same namespace as the ScaledObject
    triggers:
      - type: external
        metricType: Value                                         # Set to `Value` to achieve instance per session behaviour
        metadata:
          scalerAddress: {{ include "ServiceBusSessionScaler.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local:{{ .Values.service.port }}
          queueName: YOUR_QUEUE_NAME_HERE                         # Optional. Service Bus Queue to scale on. This or topicName and subscriptionName has to be provided. 
                                                                  #           Takes precedence over topicName and subscriptionName.
          topicName: YOUR_TOPIC_NAME_HERE                         # Optional. Service Bus Topic to scale on. Cannot be provided if queueName is used.
          subscriptionName: YOUR_TOPIC_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME_HERE     # Optional. Service Bus Topic Subscription to scale on. Has to be provided if topicName is provided.
          sessionCount: 1                                         # Optional. Count of sessions to trigger scaling on. Default is 1 session.
          activationSessionCount: 0                               # Optional. Target value for activating the scaler (scaling from 0). Default is 0.
          connectionStringSetting: SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING  # Optional. Environment variable name to read connection string with SharedAccessKey from. Default is SERVICE_BUS_CONNECTION_STRING.
                                                                  #           Unlike regular KEDA scalers, the environment variable is to be set on the session-scaler, not on the scaled deployment.
                                                                  #           Pass `env` option to set environment variables on this release. Each trigger can use a different connection string.
